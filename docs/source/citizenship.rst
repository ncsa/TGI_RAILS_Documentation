Good Cluster Citizenship
============================

**You share TGI RAILS with many other users**, and what you do on
the system affects others. Exercise good citizenship to ensure that your
activity does not adversely impact the system and the research community
with whom you share it. Here are some rules of thumb:

-  Don’t run production jobs on the login nodes (very short time debug
   tests are fine)
-  Don’t stress file systems with known-harmful access patterns (many
   thousands of small files in a single directory)
-  If you encounter an issue, submit an informative `help ticket <help>`_ including loaded modules
   (module list) and stdout/stderr messages if possible.
