Getting Help
================

For assistance with the use of TGI RAILS

-  For all issues regardless of allocation type, please send email to
   help@ncsa.illinois.edu.
- Be sure to include that you are seeking help for the TGI RAILS system. In the body of the email, include as many details as possible. It is generally helpful to include what you're trying to do, error output (as text, not images), and a list of modules you had loaded at the time the error occurred (run "module list" and paste the output into the message), and any other relevant information.  
- Include your TGI RAILS username and the name of the allocation account that you use to submit jobs.  
   
Please keep in mind that staff support is only available during business hours and a 
response may take a full business day.
