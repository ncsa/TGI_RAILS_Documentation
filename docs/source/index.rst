Introduction
=================

TGI RAILS is a high-performance computing and data analysis system, funded by the National Science 
Foundation and the Taylor Geospatial Institute and managed and operated at the National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. The RAILS system is available for use 
by any of the academic institutions that make up the Taylor Geospatial Institute. RAILS is also 
accessible via the `Open Science Grid https://osg-htc.org/`_.

RAILS provides a highly capable GPU-focused compute environment for GPU and CPU workloads coupled 
with a VAST filesystem, providing high-speed access to large datasets. The system is designed to 
support a wide range of geospatial research and data analysis tasks, including machine learning, 
deep learning, and other AI-related workloads.
 
Who is eligible to use TGI RAILS?
==================================
Geospatial related researchers, faculty, and staff at each of the TGI member organizations are 
eligible to use RAILS for geospatial-related research. The system can also be used in courses of 
any discipline. Additionally up to 20% of RAILS capability is accessible via the `Open Science 
Grid. https://osg-htc.org/`_.

Getting Started with High-Performance Computing
================================================

**There are no specific prerequisite courses or high-performance computing (HPC) experience 
required before using Delta.** 
However, if you are unfamiliar with using an HPC cluster, it is highly recommended that you take 
NCSA’s short tutorial `Using an HPC Cluster for Scientific Applications <https://www.hpc-training.org/moodle/course/view.php?id=71>`_ 
before continuing.

Browse NCSA’s `HPC-Moodle <https://www.hpc-training.org>`_ for a full list of HPC training 
opportunities including self-paced tutorials and training events (in-person and virtual).
