Introduction
=================

*TGI RAILS* is a regional computing system funded by the NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure program for primary use by the TGI consortium for geospatial related research. RAILS provides a highly capable GPU-focused compute environment for GPU and CPU workloads.

RAILS has three CPU-only nodes and three 8-way NVIDIA H100-based GPU nodes.  Every RAILS node has high-performance node-local SSD storage (1.92 TB for CPU nodes, 3.5 TB for GPU nodes), and is connected to the 1 PB VAST filesystem via the high-speed interconnect.  The RAILS resource uses the SLURM workload manager for job scheduling.
