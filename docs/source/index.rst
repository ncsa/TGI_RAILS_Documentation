Introduction
=================

TGI RAILS is a high-performance computing and data analysis system, funded by the National Science 
Foundation and the Taylor Geospatial Institute, and managed and operated at the National Center of 
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. The RAILS system is available for use 
by the regional consortium of academic institutions of the Taylor Geospatial Institute.

RAILS provides a highly capable GPU-focused compute environment for GPU and CPU workloads coupled with a VAST filesystem, providing high-speed access to large datasets. The system is designed to support a wide range of geospatial research and data analysis tasks, including machine learning, deep learning, and other AI-related workloads.
